## TODO

### Graph

* **Please learn how to solve anything on chordal graph** (Ptz 2018 Winter. Kid's Nightmare)
* Ear Decomposition, ST ordering of biconnected graph (Old MIPT graph training, Southern subregional 2016, Nordic OI 2019)
* PQ tree, 3-connectivity (Details written in my notion)
* Online Incremental SCC https://arxiv.org/abs/0803.0792 (Details written in my notion)
* Dynamic 2-connectivity, 3-connectivity https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.03812 (Details written in my notion)
* Online Dynamic MST http://phdopen.mimuw.edu.pl/lato16/italiano-slides/1-connectivity.pdf
* MCMF in $O(n \log n)$ time for series-parallel graphs
* Directed MST in $O(m\log^2 m)$ 
* Bipartite graph edge coloring in $O(m \log ^2 m)$
* k shortest path algorithm
* k smallest spanning tree algorithm

### Data structures

* Top trees?
* Segment tree beats?
* Link cut memphis (?????)
* Solve Tetris 3D from POI 2006
* Solve WF 2017 Scenery in $O(n\log n)$

### Etc

* SMAWK
* $log, exp$ on polynomials efficiently

### Maybe

* Matrix chain product in $O(n \log n)$ 
* General matching in $O(VE^{1/2})$
* Preflow-push algorithms? 
* Suffix automaton
